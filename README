This is a crude tester for dmd, druntime, and phobos.

The server pieces are in a script language for which I can't share the engine.
The client pieces are just shell scripts.

Given the crudeness of the code, there's assumptions about my environment
and hosts that will need to be edited out.

I run it from the client dir with:

   $ while /bin/true; do ./src/driver.sh; sleep 3600; done
